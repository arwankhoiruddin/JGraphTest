# JGraphTest

This is repository for creating a new tool for testing using Graph

The idea is to make tester works to be much easier. Rather than writing all test cases, they will need to simply write TestComponents and connect all the TestComponents. This tool will traverse all the path from the connected TestComponents and perform the test automatically.
